# Group12: Final Project for Principle of Software Requirements

## Topic: Airport Management System

### Overview: 
**Design and develop a flight mangement system which is responsible for scheduling flights based on the time of arrival/departure. Our OEA or Oshawa Executive Airport also allows the airport authority to manage and avoid flight related disasters.**

# Navigating through the code

* Open the [login.html](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/Group12/blob/main/Code/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/login.html) page on your browser.
* After a successful login, user will end up on the [Home Page](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/Group12/blob/main/Code/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/index.html)
* Navigate to the "[Engineer's View](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/Group12/blob/main/Code/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/engineersView.html)" from the drop-down to fill out the Sure Check form.
* Click submit and Navigate to the "[ATC's View](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/Group12/blob/main/Code/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/atcSureCheck.html)" from the dropdown. Here you will find the all submitted sure check form data.
* If all parameters of the aircraft are flight worthy, navigate to the "[Scheduling](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/Group12/blob/main/Code/bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/OEA.html)" tab and enter the fields as per the Sure Check fields.
* If there are no time conflicts this new field will get added to the scheduling table.
